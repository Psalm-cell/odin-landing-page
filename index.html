                <p class="text">A meat pie is a pie with a filling of meat and often with other savory ingredients. They are found in cuisines worldwide. Meat pies are usually baked, fried, or deep fried to brown them and develop the flavour through the Maillard reaction. Many varieties have a flaky crust due to the incorporation of butter to develop a flaky texture when baking.</p>

                <p class="text">Yam porridge/Yam pottage, or Asaro as the Yoruba people of Nigeria call it, is a delicious savory dish. It is made with white yam tubers, simmered in a pepper mix, mostly seasoned with dehydrated prawns (crayfish), and finished with green leaves. It gets its beautiful hue, which the Yorubas often call “Asaro rede rede,” from unrefined palm oil.</p>
